# Agentic AI Fundamentals

## What Makes AI "Agentic"?

Traditional AI systems are **reactive** - they respond to inputs with outputs. Agentic AI systems are **proactive** - they can:

- **Plan** multi-step actions to achieve goals
- **Reason** about their environment and situation
- **Use tools** to interact with the world
- **Adapt** their behavior based on feedback
- **Collaborate** with other agents

## Core Components of Agentic AI

### 1. **Reasoning Engine**
The "brain" that processes information and makes decisions
- Language models (LLMs) for understanding and generation
- Planning algorithms for multi-step workflows
- Memory systems for context and learning

### 2. **Tool Integration**
Interfaces to interact with external systems
- API calls to web services
- Database queries
- File system operations
- Hardware control

### 3. **Perception**
Ability to understand the environment
- Text processing
- Image recognition
- Audio analysis
- Sensor data interpretation

### 4. **Action Execution**
Methods to carry out decisions
- Generate responses
- Execute code
- Send messages
- Trigger workflows

## Google ADK Architecture

### Agent Framework
```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Agent Core    │ ← Main reasoning engine

```

### Key ADK Components

1. **Agent Definition**: Core agent behavior and capabilities
2. **Tool Registry**: Available functions and APIs
3. **Conversation Manager**: Handles interactions and context
4. **Execution Engine**: Runs agent workflows
5. **Monitoring**: Tracks performance and behavior

## Agent Design Patterns

### 1. **Single Agent**
One agent handles all tasks
- Simple to implement
- Good for focused use cases
- Limited scalability

### 2. **Multi-Agent System**
Multiple specialized agents
- Each agent has specific expertise
- Coordinator manages interactions
- Scalable and robust

### 3. **Hierarchical Agents**
Agents organized in layers
- High-level strategy agents
- Mid-level coordination agents  
- Low-level execution agents

## Real-World Applications

- **Customer Service**: Automated support with human-like reasoning
- **Content Creation**: AI writers that research and plan content
- **Data Analysis**: Agents that explore datasets and generate insights
- **Software Development**: Code-writing agents that understand requirements
- **Research**: Agents that gather information and synthesize findings
