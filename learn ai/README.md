# Learning Agentic AI with Google ADK

This repository contains my journey learning agentic AI using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK).

## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can:
- **Reason** about problems and make decisions
- **Use tools** to interact with the world
- **Plan** multi-step workflows
- **Adapt** to changing conditions
- **Collaborate** with other agents
